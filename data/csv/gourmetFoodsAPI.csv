I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.","positive","positive","0.482862","0.262573"

Bell ""Lifelong Sci-Fi/Fantasy Fan""",0,2,2007-12-20 19:00:00,"Good product - Amazon Screwups","Two parts to this review - one for the product and one for Amazon1) I love this turkey pepperoni. Great taste, low calories, and little fat. It's a much healthier product than standard pepperoni. My main complaint is I have had several packages where the pepperonin are encased in mold. I couldn't see any visible holes or slits in the packaging, but the product inside was solid green and grey. This is not Amazon's fault since they just ship a box of 12 that came straight from the manufacturer with all the original labelling etc. One other time, I received only 11 of 12 packages inside the box.2) The product listing is incorrect on this page or Amazon is unable to get it right. It's listed as a pack of 12 6-ounce packages. I have ordered this product numerous times, and Amazon always ships a pack of 12 3-ounce packages. As I said above, the product is in its original packaging from the manufacturer and it clearly says in big bold letters ""12 3 oz. packages"" right on the box. Amazon then applies their own sticker saying ""12 6 oz packages"". I have ordered this product 4 different times and each time I only got half an order. To Amazon's credit, they have fixed it everytime (for me) but seem incapable of fixing the problem at the source. Either the website is listing the wrong size or someone in the warehouses can't read or do simple math. I have discussed this with customer service each time, but they still haven't fixed it.So, 4 stars for the product. 4 stars for Amazon always fixing my order in the end. 0 stars for Amazon's ability to correct a simple problem.","positive","negative","0.54052","-0.0525709"

On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi.Recommended.****","positive","positive","0.810578","0.504908"

However, the 6.1-ounce plastic container of this product is no longer available in any of my local retail stores (although a smaller package of individually portioned coffee containers is, at an exhorbitant price). Further, the best price of the Tasters Choice 6.1-ounce-package hazelnut coffee has increased from about $6.00 (store price) to nearly $57.00 (internet price, including shipping) during the past two years -- representing over a 800 percent price increase! Hence, it is no longer economically feasable for me to purchase this brand coffee. Other brands are either not acceptable for reasons of unacceptable taste or exhorbitant cost.Several years ago I tried hazelnut flavor tablets for my instant coffee and found them to be satisfactory, if not convenient (since there are two ingredients, instead of one, at each preparation).I therefore recently ordered Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets from Amazon on a trial basis. Because I combined this order with another, Amazon charged no shipping and handling fees.The cost proved to be satisfactory, and the Flavor Creations Hazelnut tablets added to another good, but less expensive, brand of coffee made the total cost far more satisfactory.

Adding a few tablespoons to a bowl of soup adds a nice flavor and creaminess that I love and find hard to achieve usually since I don't use milk products. On pasta, it creates a nice &#34;mac and cheese&#34; and is a good replacement for parmesan on spaghetti. If I'm in a hurry in the morning, it's super easy to sprinkle some on toast. It is easy to create a sauce with just some of these flakes and some soy milk or water (along with other spices depending on your taste), which can be added to steamed vegetables, rice, or any number of other foods.

If I wanted a vitamin B complex tablet, I would just take one.What's more, some of the B vitamins (e.g., folic acid and B6) are of the variety that you may want to be careful not to oversupplement. I doubt the amount added to the yeast would actually create a problem (B6 and folic acid ""overdoses"" don't really make the news much), but I wanted healthy food here, not food plus extra synthetic (I presume) stuff that I hadn't planned on -- even if most people would argue that the addition is innocuous.Maybe most (or all?) nutritional yeast is this way -- I don't know;I'm no expert on the subject -- but this addition wasn't what I expected and it wasn't what I wanted.

I haven't tried any other brands of nutritional yeast, for whatever it's worth. That said, this definitely added a LOT of flavor to the tofu bacon. The end result of the recipe wouldn't exactly be something I would call ""bacon"", but it was really, really good in its own right. After refrying up some of the leftovers (which had a chance for the flavors to sit), I got the distinct impression that I was eating slices of pork roast. A lot of that I attribute to the nutritional yeast. Part of the reason this stuff is so good is that it contains a LOT of glutamic acid. This amino acid is of course present in MSG, among many other completely natural, healthy things. Do I feel like I'm being naughty by adding this to things? Not really. It tastes good, and it has nutritional value (a complete protein I believe?) for a vegetarian.","positive","positive","0.582697","0.366924"

Pour it over a pound of cooked noodles like macaroni and bake it for a while and you have rich mac and ""cheese"".When I'm eating lots of this Nutritional yeast I notice feeling more energetic. It's loaded with B vitamins and protein.Check vegweb for the actual recipe. I think it's ""Best mac and cheese in the world, seriously"" or something like that. I also use it for a breakfast scramble. Just fry up the potatoes, onions, peppers and whatever you want, then pour on some sauce and let it cook down for a minute or two. Delicious!Some people find something a bit funny about the taste of Nutritional Yeast. But like most things, if you don't go in with an expectation of how it should taste (many people are expecting cheese), you may really like it.

Before buying this brand, I had been buying Red Star Nutritional Yeast from my local store and dumping it on lots of things, on salads, in smoothies, on popcorn. I'm a borderline vegetarian and wasn't taking any B supplements so I figured that the yeast was a good idea. But as has been noted, it's pretty expensive. The Kal brand is a better deal and I just fill an old 5 oz Red Star container to make it easier to dispense. (I slightly prefer the Red Star product hence the 4 stars.) There is a point I must sadly bring up, though, and it's that if you use a heavy hand, you may see ""results"" where you don't want them. According to the label, 3 rounded tablespoons are 80 calories. By the time you've scarfed down the whole cannister of yeast flakes, you'll have consumed almost 2500 calories.

Nutritional yeast is a little expensive for the most part, especially in local stores. Buying in bulk is your best option, especially if you're like me and are addicted to the stuff. I'm glad I found this product (I purchased the 22 oz size, by the way). It's cheap and lasts quite a while. Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy sort of flavor (try toasting it before using it in recipes), and can also impart a chicken-type flavor. I'm constantly making vegan ""cheese"" sauces and adding it to broths and gravies for a savory taste. It can be an acquired taste - some people love it right away; most have to grow into it. I didn't really like it at first, but now I'm obsessed with the stuff (similar to tofu).I recommend VegWeb.com for yummy recipes; the Tangy Cheeseless Cheese Sauce is my favorite! Try sprinkling it straight onto popcorn and pasta dishes. Bryanna Clark Grogan has a recipe for ""Chicken-Style Broth Powder"" using mainly nutritional yeast.BONUS: It's actually good for you! It's packed with amino acids, minerals, and B vitamins, including B12 (which all vegans should know is hard to get from a vegan diet). It's low in sodium and fat, and is suitable for most selective diets.","neutral","positive","0","0.551206"

This might sound silly, but I've actually started prefering the nutritional yeast to shredded cheeses because I have come to love the taste so much!

You can't go wrong and the best of all: excellent taste and quality, and for a pack of five this comes at a good value.Sometimes your diet will require you eat frequently and consciously, and in those cases you need to have a snack at hand when you get hungry, in order to keep your metabolism high all day long. In such cases finding a good and balance option could be hard. I love this 5-pack and I always have one at home an another pack at the office. I try to eat five or more times a day, so in my case having a healthy snack at hand wherever I am when I get hungry is a priority.Since you are checking this product I have to guess that you are probably a person that cares about what you eat, either because you are interested in losing weight, getting in better shape or just be healthier and keep in good shape, so I will share my own experience in the weight loss game and staying in shape gameMy own successful personal experience in weight loss is based on strategies to boost metabolism. Don't stress yourself, eat frequently, eat just what you need each time, and choose wisely what you are going to eat, supplement your diet. Yet simple and it works. I loss more than 200 lbs and shrink my waist (from 44 to 32), and I have been able to keep in good shape since then. Every single aspect of my life has improved since then.Keep in mind that a good diet is just part of the equation, you also need a plan that helps you keep on track and monitor your condition. Based on my own personal experience I can recommend some tools that you may want to consider, to establish your own strategies for boosting your metabolism, loosing weight, and even more important keeping that weight off. They are:- ""Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss"" by Mark Hyman. A practical an realistic plan for weigh loss.- ""The ABS Diet"", which is another very practical, readable, insightful, and inspirational book, that also includes an exercise plan.- A Body Fat Monitor or Scale. This will help you monitor your progress, to assure that the weight you are loosing is fat (fat lost = increased metabolism) and not muscle, water or bone mass (decreased metabolism).- A Heart Rate Monitor Wrist Watch. This is an excellent tool that will help you monitor and control your Heart Rate in order to keep yourself in a burning fat state (increased metabolism).- ""Heart Monitor Training for the Complete Idiot"", a primer on the use of Heart Rate Monitors for health improvement or weight control.If you want to star focusing only on your diet, the first two may be worth considering. If you exercise, or want to start doing it right, the last threee are for you. If you do both, all the recommended options can improve your results.I am 39 years old, With the help of the tools I just mentioned not only I went fro size 44 to size 32 pants, but also obtained substantial benefits that included weight control, cardiovascular improvements, lowered blood pressure, and improved muscular-skeletal strength and flexibility, but also the myriad of mental and psychological benefits derived from being in the best shape of my life.","positive","positive","0.898996","0.443028"

Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of ""acquired taste"" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the ""water of life"" (""uisgue beatha"") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk.

Unlike other reviewers, I do not taste any hint of Bragg's Aminos in ""Ginger & Sesame Salad Dressing"" (even though it is listed among the ingredients), in anycase, it could use alot more.The biggest problem I have with premixed ""oil and vinegar"" dressings is that if you put them in the frig, the oil solidifies---meaning you have to wait a half-an-hour everytime you want to use the oil. Leaving the dressing ""out"", here in the tropics, is inadvisable. In addition, I find salad dressings from which the components settle out in a few seconds to be annoying, forcing me to shake-and-pour, shake-and-pour, shake-and-pour. However, oil and vinegar, separately, do NOT have to be refrigerated, and do not have to be shaken. If you want an oil-and-vinegar dressing, it is better to simply use oil, vinegar (or lemon juice) and spices separately:For a moderately premium olive oil, I recommend ColavitaColavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)For vinegar, you can use Bragg's Apple Vinegar.Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar, 32 oz liquidor a nice balsalmic vinegar. However fresh lemon juice (and a little lemon zest) is much better.Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/GraterIf you want sesame flavor, mix a little sesame oil with your oil, or drizzle it on separately. For example:Kadoya - Pure Sesame Oil 5.5 Oz.Dry sesame seeds are also available in the spice section of most grocery stores, which you can sprinkle on salads. For example:Bob's Red Mill White Sesame Seeds, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)If you want ginger flavor, grate a little fresh ginger over your salad using the microplane zester. My grocery sells tubes of minced ginger in the cool-foods section---the tubes are almost as good as fresh ginger. Dried ginger is available in the spice section of your grocery. For example:GINGER GROUND FRESHLY PACKED IN LARGE JARS, spices, herbs, seasoningsFor example:S&B; - Oroshi (Shoga ginger paste) in tube 1.41 Oz.Instead of salt, spinkle a little Braggs Aminos on your salad.Otherwise, I prefer stiff mayonaise-based dressings. They can be refrigerated without solidifying, and ""stick"" to the vegies better. I usually add flavors and spices (fresh ginger, cilantro, garlic, lemon zest, minced olives, minced dill pickle, mustard seeds, etc.) to mayonaise, as needed for the particular salad or vegetable dish I plan to serve. Similar homemade mayo-based condiment makes a super sandwich spread, a ""sauce"" for vegetables side-dishes, or a dip for battered fish, ""french"" fries, tempura, etc. For non-leafy salads and for vegetables, I often serve the dressing ""on the side"" and use it more as a dip.Conclusion: Braggs Ginger & Sesame salad dressing is a good salad dressing, but I like something a little more convenient and flavorful.General RecommendationAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it. If you watch, you'll be surprised by how radically and quickly the prices on Amazon can change. I've seen many examples of prices doubling (or dropping in half) over an hour's time. $5.49 (the price at the time of this writting is a good price---I just paid $7.15 at a local grocery).","negative","positive","-0.414345","0.865135"

It's a complaint many people have about low-carbing. Now, if you're doing it right, it shouldn't be that way, but sometimes it just happens. Also, someone with chronic illnesses and also those who take pain medication regularly might find themselves with a bout of constipation too. So while I know this is called a 'dieter's tea' and I know that some people use it for cleansing and even for dangerous weight loss by drinking too much of it to 'flush out' the foods they eat, this tea can actually be used safely and for good purposes when used properly for constipation relief.It takes a little bit to find the right level of brewing to make this work for you. Too little, and it doesn't do much, too much and you'll explode and run to the bathroom almost right after drinking it. Find the right balance, the right steeping level vs. water for you, and you'll simply have a normal, easy relief the next morning. Once or twice per week, after a meal, works great for most folks I've talked to. Works wonderful for me when needed.The flavor is great too. I've tried the other flavors of this brand, and I don't like them. My best friend likes the lemon though, so to each their own, but for me, the cinnamon is the best. It's lightly sweet on its own, but sometimes I'll still add a little honey.Good stuff, and if properly steeped, it doesn't cause cramping or pain or unflattering gas, with a decent taste.

My grandmother is 92, and when she came to live with me, she had been nervous about the move etc. Long story short, she was &#34;plugged up&#34; and hadn't gone in nearly two weeks. She has had a kidney removed, so the Dr. said to steer clear of any magnesium based products. So knowing that, I tried a more natural approach.I tried the orange fiber powder, green tea with honey, prune juice, apple juice, and after nothing had worked, laxatives for three straight days.... And still nothing!So this had been sitting in my cupboard for ages, and I remembered that when I had used this, it sent me to the bathroom.I gave her a large cup of this and by the next afternoon...well, let's just say &#34;Laci Le Beau helped her go, go go.&#34;She still has problems with regularity, so every 4 days, I give her a cup of this to keep everything in order.I'd give this five stars, but the new bags are VERY flimsy. With the old bags, I would let them steep for 15 minutes, squeeze the bag to get the strong oils out, and steep again for another 15 or so...The other day I was using the new 2012 bags and was using a hot/cold office (5 gallon bottles) dispenser. I put the teabag in the cup and the force of the water actually burst the bag open as I was filling the cup. I had tea leaf bits floating in my cup. Whatever material they are using now is so weak, I'll have to add the teabag to the water after the cup is full. I certainly won't be able to squeeze the last bits of oils out of the leaves now...Still worth 4 stars though. Oh and one more thing... I add some lemon juice and honey to this.

I've tried the ""original"" flavor (which is... herb-y and kind of gross), but this is a review for the cinnamon spice (which is still slightly herb-y, but tastes pretty decent.)I never understand why these teas are marketed as ""dieter's tea"". Don't use this to lose weight. The only weight you'll lose is from all that crap and water you're expelling from your bowels (literally crap. I made a poop joke. Hehe. Okay, sorry. Back to my review.)If you want to lose weight, eat less ""standard American diet"" foods, eat more veggies, and move more. The end. Seriously, don't use this as your weight loss method. I've tried it, and it just gives you stomach cramps for a few weeks, and you'll lose more friends than pounds because basically you just have diarrhea all the time.The real purpose of the product? It's for pooping.This is a laxative tea for when you're constipated. If you've never had this before, here's what I discovered about a decade ago, when I was a teenager with body image issues and found my mom's ""dieter's tea"": brewed myself a huge cup (kept the teabag in), chugged it, spent the next night and day with wild stomach cramping and diarrhea. Lovely, am I right? To combat this, keep the brew times short, especially at first. You should feel... something... within 24 hours.Overusing laxatives will make you have even more bowel problems. It contains senna, which is a ""natural"" compound, but your body will start to get used to it, and you'll need more and more, every time, and suddenly your anus is either leaking or so clenched up that you can't poop without help. Apparently, you can use it safely up to 30 days, but I personally don't use it more than 2 days in a row, and I pretty much only use it if for whatever reason (stress, forgetting to eat any veggies/fruits, etc) I have been constipated for more than 2 days. I like it better than senna tablets, but it's hard to control how strong the tea will be.If you're chronically constipated, I would personally suggest using this a few days a week, and supplementing your diet with a fiber supplement likeVitafusion Fiber Gummies 220 Count Sugar Freeor by adding a bunch of fibrous plants/veggies and other natural sources of fiber into your diet.)If you're into ""cleanses"", holyyy mother, this will make you feel pretty empty inside, like an angsty teenager. Just take a few strong cups, brace yourself through the cramping, and prepare to feel nice and clean inside. Don't do this too often, though, and don't do this if you need to work the next day.The cinnamon spice flavor tastes pretty good, but not a super strong cinnamon taste, as I expected/hoped. The box I got came with 2 medium-sized plastic bags (sealed) of tea bags. The tea bags that I got are pretty well constructed. I put them in an airtight container for storage. If you don't have one, keep them in a ziplock. If you leave them exposed to air, the tea will taste stale after a few weeks.","negative","negative","-0.30939","-0.346476"

Potassium chloride tastes more like table salt than anything else I've tried, but it does have a bit of a metallic after taste. I've fairly-well masked that, though, by mixing 150 parts of potassium chloride with one part of citric acid crystals (also called sour salt). Citric acid has a very strong lemon flavor which is so strong by itself that it's difficult to use a small enough quantity of it. By mixing a small amount of it with potassium chloride, the citric acid flavor is much diluted, which makes it much easier to use, and the potassium chloride metallic after taste essentially disappears.EDIT: I keep changing the ratio of KCl to citric acid. Now I appear to have settled on about 1/4 of a teaspoon of citric acid per 3 oz. shaker of Nu-Salt. I think that works out to about 72 parts KCl to one part citric acid.

It also seems to bring out accompanying flavors, such as garlic, just as well as real salt does.The only slight problem, and the reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it doesn't have an after-taste but an ""after-effect"". I get a very slight feeling of tightness in my throat, like when you salivate before vomiting. It sounds a lot worse than it is, because it's a very mild effect.

I've never used it as a salt substitute, however, although judging by the taste, you probably won't be thrilled with it unless you have a strict sodium-intake dietary restriction.This stuff is just incredible in the amount of potassium it packs in such a small amount. 1/6 teaspoon will give you a whopping 530mg of potassium. Because, by law, in the US, supplements are limited to 99mg per tablet, I didn't feel like spending all that money for pills and downing a bunch of them throughout the day (3500mg being the RDA, for potassium). I have current restriction on my food intake that make it impossible to receive the RDA of Potassium the natural way, so I needed to find a different way to get it in my system. The supplements you would otherwise have to purchase (unless you had a prescription for a higher grade from your doctor) are capped at that amount (99mg) for specific reasons that you should check out on the wikipedia entry for ""potassium"", if you want to be sure you'll be OK. I only take the 1/6 teaspoon at a time-4 x's a day-just to be on the safe side. I wouldn't recommend taking the whole daily allowance at one time. You'll be asking for trouble that way. I have serious cramps in both legs at times, and while I'm unable to prevent them while I'm sleeping, as soon as I feel the crap coming on, I rush to the NuSalt, place a bit under my tongue to get it in my system immediately and then dilute the rest in water and drink it.

Nu-Salt, in fact, could make matters worse for some people on a salt restricted diet! Nu-Salt substitutes one salt for another salt. Table salt is sodium chloride and Nu-Salt substitutes that for potassium chloride.Now here is what the Cleveland Clinic says about this type of product (Mayo and Cleveland are generally considered the top two health organizations in the USA): ""Salt substitutes are NOT a healthful option for EVERYONE. Many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride in place of sodium chloride. Potassium consumed in excess may be harmful for some people ... a salt substitute containing potassium chloride is an acceptable alternative in moderation, if you do NOT HAVE kidney problems and have checked with your physician to be sure it will not interact with any of your medications""Additional research found statements like this: ""salt substitutes are low-sodium alternatives designed to taste similar. They usually contain mostly potassium chloride, whose toxicity is approximately equal to that of table salt in a healthy person ....However, various diseases and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing the risk of potentially FATAL hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure or diabetes should NOT use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, Lo Salt, has issued an advisory statement""Note the reference to kidney problems, diabetes and heart failure - the three groups of people most likely to be in need of reducing their salt intake. The likelihood that this product will interact with some typical blood pressure medications is fairly high. The warning about this product possibly interacting with medications should NOT be ignored.I'll conclude with a direct quote from the Nu-Salt web site: ""Please consult with your physician before using Nu-Salt.""I would NOT recommend this product unless you have consulted with your physician first! It clearly takes a physician or other health care professional to decide whether this is a suitable alternative to table salt on an individual basis.","negative","negative","-0.800406","-0.19451"

We use Subscribe & Save on Amazon to keep these babies in stock all the time. They are also great for dips, because they are so stout you don't have to worry about them breaking off in the dip, and they are way healthier than most other chips I see laid out with dips at parties.(I also highly suggest Stacy's Pita Chips for another great, healthy, crunchy accompaniment.)","positive","positive","0.672531","0.47513"

Maybe that's why Halloween is my favorite holiday and I start celebrating it in September! Since pumpkin pie is my favorite dessert I ordered these Pumpkin Gingerlies simply because I have never had a pumpkin flavored cookie before. The beauty of the Immaculate Baking Co. is the deep flavor each tiny cookie has. Each little treat is about two bites and is satisfying and flavorful, I don't feel the need to eat a huge cookie when I can have one or two of these guys and feel my sugar cravings bite the dust!What hit me first was the spicy, tropical ginger, then the mellow buttery pumpkin, it really tastes like a mini pumpkin pie, crust and all. The flavor combination was superb, from peppery and zingy it melted into luscious, creamy milky pumpkin. These cookies are packaged in 2oz. bags that are easy to throw in my purse and take with me wherever the road leads that day. Each baggie is only 130 calories and these are so rich and delicious I feel like I am eating a whole pie and at times can't even finish the little bag. I love knowing they are all natural with no trans fats and the brand is not only eye catching but worth the consumer's time.For those who like their life a little sweet, a little spicy and definitely tasty this is the cookie for them! These were a lovely surprise but since trying few other flavors from Immaculate Baking Co I do not get surprised anymore, I know their cookies will taste great and I am never disappointed.- Kasia S.","neutral","positive","0","0.642302"

It diesn't leave an aftertaste as some do and isn't over-powering. This is my choice to drink alone without any food. I think cookies or biscuits or whatever would over power it. When I have my coffe with food I choose a stronger roast. So for a late morning or mid afternoon cup, or a cup at my desk, this is just right. For breakfast something stronger would be better.All that said, I can almost always find these K cups much cheaper at my local stores than at Amazon.","positive","positive","0.66589","0.170422"

I'm the kind that prefers to brew coffee in an all-glass vacuum pot/syphon with a glass filter rod so the oils don't get absorbed by paper or fabric filters and metal doesn't alter the taste. So I don't usually drink office coffee, because it's usually garbage. Sometimes just for the heat or the caffeine, I'll drink a few cups, though.But back in February I started a new contract, and these guys have one of these K-cup things. Seems like a silly gimmick to me, and a pretty environmentally unfriendly one... but one day I needed some caffeine and started trying the coffees. The first one I tried was a costa rican thing which tasted like someone mixed maxwell house with starbucks and pencil shavings and filtered it through a moderately clean sock. The second one was a columbian one that tasted like maxwell house with less starbucks, more pencil shavings, and a dirty sock. Then someone opened a box of this Kenya stuff, and I rolled my eyes and tried it... and really liked it. It's not the best coffee in the world, but it's very drinkable. Smooth and soft, reasonably rich and robust... it's a nice no-heartburn beverage. I usually toss an ounce of cold water in the bottom of the cup because it doesn't taste so great when it's still at cautious sipping heat, but at a good drinkable temperature it's very doable. Feels like a dark roast without the bitter burned taste, almost like a peaberry. Doubt it's that, but whatever's in it, I'll happily swill down a few cups of it on a day when I want something besides water or tea... not just on days when I need caffeine.","positive","positive","0.809351","0.0104493"

I will continue to try all of the recommended brands hoping to find that ""ahhhhh"" flavor. In the meantime, I use the little filter adaptor that allows me to use my own ground beans in the machine.

The Van Houtte French Vanilla is a light roast so I obviously knew it wasn't going to be strong. But to be devoid of any flavor is not acceptable. When I made the coffee this morning, I even paused the Keurig during the brew cycle to wet the grounds better in order to produce a more flavorful cup. I also used the 8 oz setting rather than the 10 oz setting on my machine. None of this had any effect. The coffee pouring into my cup was a nice, rich color but there was no coffee or vanilla aroma emanating from it.In this case, I honestly don't understand the positive reviews on this product.

The Kettle Corn has clear white kernals of popped corn, and there is not the first hint of yellow residue anywhere.The best feature: 94% fat-free! Although I am a bit confused and uncertain over what the actual fat content of a bag is (read the label of unpopped kernals v.s. popped corn--whaat?); as near as I can tell it is 2g of fat per popped bag, which yields approximately 3 cups of popped corn. Excellent! Since this is kettle corn, it is a great fix for a sweet tooth that also wants a crunchy snack.

The flavor is very similar to actual cotton candy. I have ordered the variety pack as well, and those are also just as good. A few may come broken, but that is almost impossible to prevent due to the fact that they are being shipped. I still eat the broken ones, i just open them up and put them in a bowl, they are still good. They stay in the wrapper even if they break, so they are still clean. 12 bucks for 48 lollipops is a really fair price, so I don't think it's that big of a deal if a few come broken. I have ordered them about 3 or 4 times, and there's usually only about 5 or 6 that come broken. I have never seen them in any of the stores I shop at either. It's hard to find just good old fashion candy. They ship very fast and come in the manufacture box, with bubble wrap around it, in an Amazon box.

I eat a lot of candy to deal with medication-induced nausea, and nothing beats it down faster, (and I do mean nothing) than very sweet candy. The sweeter the better.How do these taste? They are definitely cotton candyish. I say ""ish"" because they aren't exactly like it, but are close enough that you can taste it in there. The flavor is like a mix of the pink and blue flavors, so the blend makes it seem a little off from what the real candy tastes like. But they are for sure a good flavored pop. They also have very little aftertaste.Since these are a flat sucker you will get a few that are broken in most boxes. It's kind of an expected issue with any hard flat candy. They could probably prevent any breakage by bubble wrapping them individually, but then they would cost $5.00 each.After reading the one-star review on these I decided to mention that these are NOT actual cotton candy on a stick. (See picture I posted.) I know it seems that this should be obvious to any rational adult or thinking child, but... apparently it's not as obvious as one would think. If these were actual cotton candy they would last about one microsecond after hitting the tongue. SO be glad they are a hard candy.Overall a five star treat.","neutral","negative","0","-0.0564711"

I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as ""creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes. Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""minty, hay like, rose"". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.****","positive","positive","0.753845","0.625802"

IMPORTANT! SEE FOLLOW-UP REVIEW","I am so addicted to these cookies! Love them! They are great for a meal substitute or snack . Not too sweet-just right. They are good for you too. What else could you want? No more dessert store bought cookies for us. One cookie and a glass of milk is pretty filling for me as the cookies are sizable. My son likes two at a time though. (Sometimes I do too!) We have disabilities in our home so 'easy' is a word we love. At first we tried the Morning Glory Cookies and loved those so ordered 4 more different kinds, caramel apple, banana nut, peanut butter with chocolate, fruit and nut . We all loved them all. The Caramel Apple went first though. My son's favorites are caramel apple, peanut butter with chocolate and banana nut. Frozen we heat in microwave 25 seconds. You really must freeze these because they are all natural. Someone said it reminded them of fruitcake but I didn't think that. I really like this one. I like the texture of the nuts in it. I want one right now but unfortunately we are out Darn it! It is not one of my son's favorites but mine and my Mom's. Do not hesitate to try these in any flavor. They are a bargain. We are getting the automatic monthly shipping next month which is even more of a bargain and will order probably 10 packages at least, for 3 people. I told you we love them!IMPORTANT FOLLOW-UP- I felt this was important to add. I had not finished my test yet so did not mention it before. I have a rare bile duct disease from a ""botched' surgery. I have to be very careful what I eat or I get terrible pains and cramping and am prone to getting pancreatitis. The list of what I can eat is very short. I loved these so decided to eat mostly just the cookies for a week, if I could, without having any pains and still feel like I always do , which is really pretty awful. I felt they are nutritious and I would drink LOTS of liquids with them as the fiber can be very constipating, and of course, take vitamins. Not only did I feel better and had more energy than before but I had NO stomach pains at all. I can't remember the last time when I have gone a week without pains. I expected some but there were none. I will say, I did not miss other foods either and actually craved these cookies. I love sweets but have to be careful and these are enough sweet to satisfy me. My son brought a cake home and I found it to be almost sickeningly sweet and no nutritional value. With the cookies It just feels like I am eating well and enjoying it immensely at the same time. (Oh, I was 'regular"" as well). These will continue to be a large part of my diet. It is so wonderful to feel better, have more energy and not have the horrible pains. Now if I can afford to buy as many as I need and for my Mom and son! I really need at least 5 cookies most days (3 meals a day plus 2 snacks) if I eat nothing else . Actually the price is very affordable for most at about 1.00 a cookie and less if you get automatic ordering which I am going to do at the first of every month. I can't believe I just now heard of these on Amazon! I am thankful to Erin for developing these cookies which are literally changing my life. God bless you Erin, and your business.","positive","positive","0.653748","0.0294209"

When she points at my breakfast asking for a bite, I feel good knowing these cookies aren't frankenfood and give her few pinches to share with her. They are a great way to start the day; paired with a cup of coffee, a bit of fruit and a glass of water -- I am totally full until lunch.The chocolate chunk raisin flavor is great, plump raisins keep the cookie moist and the large chunks of chocolate are very good.These are such a deal at less than a buck a cookie with S&S; on amazon; the ingredients and consistant product quality make it money well spent.","positive","positive","0.852057","0.225401"

There is a good amount of rasins in the cookies, but they do not overwhelm at all the chocolate but compliment it.I know Erin also sells just a chocolate cookie.

A friend picked up a bottle of Ginger Peanut Sauce from T.J. Max, as they knew I liked ginger. I cooked with it, making things like Asian snap peas, which my friends started requesting at pot luck get togethers. (They thought I spent hours making them) Sadly my bottle was running out. I looked on line to try to find more and ran across the Ginger People's website. I ordered a half a case of the Ginger Peanut sauce, and decided to try a couple of their other sauces. (All of which are excellent by the way)The website offered ""ginger chews"" which I'd bought before from Trader Joe's under Trader Joe's branding. So I ordered a couple of bags of those as I knew I liked them.By having my order reach a certain amount, the shipping was greatly reduced.Being short of the amount, I decided to try the Gin-Gins, even though I'm not a hard candy kind of guy.A few months later, I was glad I did, however, as one of my new medications gave me dry mouth during the afternoon and when I talked a lot. I was able to put a Gin-Gin in my mouth which kept me from having dry mouth or having to chew on a Ginger Chew during meetings.I recently had another new med introduced, which has a side effect of nausea, the ginger chew helps calm that down, but isn't always convenient, like at meetings, socializing, or other types of interactions with others. Gin-Gins to the rescue again.If you're prone to having an upset stomach, I can't think of too many , if any better way to settle that stomach down than a true ginger based product. Gin-Gins are the perfect all around, right in any setting answer.When taking one out of my pocket, friends, co-workers, or clients, have asked to have one. I've yet to get anything put positive responses for Gin-Gins taste. So for anyone who just likes hard candy, Gin-Gins sure seem a winner with everyone I've shared with.Try them, (and other fine selections from the Ginger People) you won't be disappointed.","positive","negative","0.889668","-0.00423371"

But the flavor and the depth of flavor is phenomenal and the fish itself is much more delicate in flavor and texture than tuna is (not that they are anything like tuna, but it's the only other canned fish I'd previously eaten).They were great just out of the can cold, but better heated up (a minute or two in the microwave, ten or so in the oven). They were tasty on their own or on bagels.

Kossick",0,5,2009-10-13 20:00:00,"A Real Low-Sodium Soup","I am on a low-sodium/sodium restricted diet for something called Meniere's Disease. As a result I have to keep my sodium under 2000mg a day, although I find it's best if I keep it between 1200 and 1800 a day, trying to hit about 1500.Most the time when I look for soup at the store, it's reduced sodium (meaning it's NOT low-sodium, but has less than the original version...low-sodium products always have to be 140mg or less). This is an actual low sodium product.While many of the reduced-sodium soups are 400-600mg a serving, a serving is not always a whole can.What I like about this is that it's 140mg for a whole 10.75 oz can. The other thing I like is that it has a lot of FLAVOR.Also, this price is pretty good. When my Target has it, that's when it actually has it, it is under $2, but my local grocery store, where I normally buy it, is over $2.I've tried several low-sodium broths before, and none of them had flavor, or at least not a good one, and are only good when used as an ingredient, and not as a soup. This actual tastes like the chicken soup my mom used to make when I was a kid, and can no longer have.In my opinion, just the right amount of chicken chunks, noodles, and veggies.If you want to kick up the flavor some more, you can add a little pepper or parsley...or even a pinch of sodium-free bouillon, such asWyler's Instant Bouillon, Sodium Free Chicken, 2.62-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)or Herb-Ox Chicken Instant Broth & Seasoning, Sodium Free, 8-Count Packets (Pack of 12).The Herb-Ox is a bit more expensive, but if you make anything that it's the main flavoring, it's worth the extra cost. As a side-note, both also make sodium-free beef bouillons. I use both the beef and chicken to make mashed potatoes, gravies, roasts...anything that needs that something extra.My real recommedation with this soup though, is to try it before you tweak it. As I said, it has a LOT of FLAVOR already, and odds are you won't want to add anything.Just in case you want to know the full-nutrition, here it is:Nutrition Facts**Amount Per Serving (serving size) = 1 canCalories 160Total Fat 4.5gSat.

I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'. I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable. It just didn't make sense. Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo. The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine. The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package. I always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough. He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open. So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods. That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods. The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water. There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done. The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away. So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods. The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water! This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out. The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried. So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee. I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate. I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod. But, that has not worked for me.So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me. I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands. So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod. It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers. It might be the next thing I try.","neutral","negative","0","-0.14696"

The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly. I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting ""steam locks"" but I have had issues when:- the pod is not inserted properly- the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine- the pod is not prepared for insertion properlyMy issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded. This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded ""steam lock""), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn't open.By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods. If you don't put it in just right, you will have problems. The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine. Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds). The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to ""break up the coffee"" within the pod before using, which has the same effect. It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups. I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle. This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.","positive","positive","0.79768","0.0306244"

I love many of this company's products so I was a bit surprised that this chili paste didn't taste any better. There are bitter notes to this sauce which I attribute to chile seeds, vinegar and an excessive amount of salt. Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.This is a good company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness. As I said - I like this company's products but not this particular one. Salt and vinegar do NOT complement chiles that well in my view.","neutral","negative","0","-0.442575"

This very product (""KTC Pure Mustard Oil"") is sold in many Indian groceries in the U.S., and everyone there will tell you that it's used for a cooking oil. If you look on the back of the bottle you will see in the labeling ""Manufactured by: KTC (Edibles) LTD.""Mustard oil is actually reputed to be particularly heart-healthy, and have a lower percentage of saturated fats than canola or other edible oil. One note, it's always briefly heated to a very hot (almost smoking) point by Indian cooks right before using.

My twins both like this one","When I first tried out the variety pack, this Winter Squash was one of the flavors that my twin babies instantly liked. I started getting subscriptions for some of the flavors one at a time. As they're getting bigger and eating more, I've added subscriptions. We've run out at times and were forced to buy at the store, and I'm now determined to just keep those subscriptions going and not run out again. I don't have a store nearby that beats the subscription price and with twins, I'm more than happy to get the packages delivered and have fewer errands. (As an aside, I'm personally beat and have learned even greater respect for parents in general. With twins, one gets humbled in short order. When I see how other parents manage, I'm always in awe at how good they are.) The jars arrive very well packaged and I've never had any problems personally. They come 12 in a box, the box is completely wrapped in lots bubble wrap so well that I need scissors to open the actual bubble wrap, and finally in a strong larger box.I have added this one knowing they like it and will readily eat it. My other 4 oz. subscriptions are: carrots, lentil and rice, chicken dinner and sweet potato. Soon I expect to add fruit flavors but the pediatrician advised to wait on fruit jars until they're just a little older and to start out with the vegetable ones. The chicken dinner, which is really chicken with brown rice, was also advised but it has more squash than chicken. When we ordered that, we crossed the threshold and departed from a vegetarian diet for our now 8+ month old babies. We are not vegetarians but consume very little meat and poultry, so I guess our babies follow our personal guidelines, although as an ideal we'd eventually be vegetarians. The only reason I didn't order the squash subscription earlier was that the chicken dinner has so much squash in it.What I've also discovered is that the features included in managing one's subscriptions (within My Account) are very good. You can tell them you're out and want the next one sooner and several other options as well. I've got several other subscriptions, such as baby formula and also some supplements for the adults in the household, and find the managing subscription feature very handy.Ingredients per label: Organic winter squash, water necessary for processing.This has 40 calories, 5% protein, 100% vitamin A, 20% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 2% iron.

See that lovely BROWNED muffin top on box picture? Welllll, I've tried several boxes of these, using different oven temperatures, making them plain, with fruit, with nuts, with everything I could think of except chocolate (hmmm, maybe I'll try that!) The tops stay a pale, pasty WHITE! Sooo unappetizing. And false advertising, IMHO.Now for the taste. Another disappointment. They are bland bland bland, blah, blah, blah! You MUST add additional ingredients or they are just plain, uh, RICEY tasting - and if you're an older celiac, you know what I mean. Those first corporate attempts at making GF mixes were hideous! These are no better. Yuck!Now for the size. I'm a pretty doggone accomplished baker if I do say so myself, both prior to my diagnosis in 1985 with non-GF ingredients, and since, using mixes and baking from scratch. These just don't RISE! See the photo with that lovely dome muffin shape? Nuh-uh. Perhaps they use old, REALLY old leavening? Dunno. But they puff up only about 1/16"" of a centimeter. Maybe. But I doubt it.Now for the boxed ingredients. Cheesh, you have to add all of the EXPENSIVE stuff to make these work. Butter, milk, eggs, and fruit/nuts/whatever. Fer cryin' out loud, it's truly no more trouble, and a WHOLE lot cheaper to make muffins from scratch.I desperately wanted to love these and give a great review. But I just cannot. Make your own muffins and save your hard-earned money for some of the Gluten-free Pantry's other mixes - I rate the following 5 stars without hesitation:Country French Bread mix - absolutely delicious!! We use our bread machine and they come out PERFECT every time! And when we've used regular oven, in our french bread loaf pans, we add some toasted sesame seeds, and they are incredible.Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - OMG - completely addictive!! Gotta watch out for these if you're on a diet. You'll want to gobble up the whole batch!Beth's All Purpose Flour - quick & easy to use for all your baking (including those homemade muffins).Spice Cake and Gingerbread Mix - delicious - and sooooo easy - I can prepare it faster than it takes my oven to heat up. (Isn't that one of the BEST reason for buying a mix?) I add additional cinammon, nutmeg, ginger - we like it that way.Coffee Cake Mix - fantastic - and EASY - the crumble topping is included. Wonderful for a breakfast treat and NOT just for Celiacs.So that's about it. Try it - you may like it. Hey - that's what makes horse racing! But don't buy a whole case in the event that you don't.Regards to all you brave Celiacs out there. Let's hope that someday science can find a solution for us to make our lives a little easier.

At first I was put off by having to add the flavoring myself (having previously used Jiffy mixes), but now I like the ability to personalize the flavoring without having to stock dozens of different mixes. However, since my 9-y-o ASD son has texture issues, dried fruits are NOT an option for us (he just drops the fruit, or the rest of the muffin, when he comes to it), so I just measure 3/4 cup of all-fruit spread. Easy and versatile! I've also used fresh mashed banana and canned pumpkin. Even made it one time with just OJ instead of milk and no mix-ins (we were at my folks' and had already started mixing when we realized there was no GFCF milk); they were delicious that way, too!One tip I would like to share with everyone: Instead of mixing the whole package of dry ingredients and the whole cup of milk at once, mix like an old-fashioned cake recipe and alternate the dry & the milk.

I prepare/bake the entire batch, eat what I want whilst warm and freeze the rest as they will dry out quickly. The scones that will be frozen I allow to cool and then wrap each one individually with foil and place in a ziplock bag. When I want a scone I just pull one out and remove the foil, wrap in a napkin and pop in the microwave for 20 or 30 seconds, or just allow to thaw in the foil to eat later.I have made beautiful chocolate chip muffins with the mix but prefer the scones much more.

We're big fans of Gluten Free Pantry's cornbread mix (which I usually make as muffins,The Gluten-Free Pantry Yankee Cornbread Mix, 12-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)), and I just tried this muffin & scone mix.I have guests coming for the weekend, so the first time I used this mix, I made a double batch (2 boxes at once), for a total of 24 regular sized muffins. This mix is perfect for adding your own fruits or nuts. I added the recommended 3/4 cup per batch of fruit (dried cranberries) and a dash of lemon oil extract. Boy did these muffins turn out great!The directions say to ""bake 16 minutes or until cake tester comes out clean"". After 16 minutes, the muffins looked done, but they weren't browned on the top at all. I put them in another 3 minutes, tested one (by eating it) at its new slightly-browned-top stage (yum); then put the rest in for another 2 minutes for a nicely mostly-browned top. After the extra 5 minutes of cooking, the muffins are not dried out or overdone. They are delicious. Everybody's oven is different, but if you try this mix and they aren't browned after the recommended baking time, you may be able, like me, to leave them in longer without any negative effect on taste or texture.We have a diabetic in the house, so counting carbs is important. If you make 12 muffins from one box of mix, and use whole milk, one muffin has 30.9 carbs.The box also has directions for making scones and pancakes from this mix.So far I've tried two Gluten Free Pantry products, and I am very happy with both of them.","positive","negative","0.504351","-0.534715"

I ordered this cornbread mix from The Gluten-Free Pantry on a whim, and the whole family is delighted with it. It tastes great and has the consistency of ""real"" cornbread.I mentioned the carb count because my son was recently diagnosed with Type I Diabetes. Until we get more used to estimating carbs in home-made foods, a mix helps us be more exact about carbs per portion. One box of this Yankee Cornbread Mix makes 12 medium-size muffins of 25.3 grams of carbs, each.We do not have to eat gluten-free, but I've always found that a gluten free muffin always makes me feel less full, less like the muffin has congealed into a ball in my stomach. So we go gluten-free at times.You add sugar, milk, egg and melted butter to the mix. It calls for buttermilk, but I make it with whole milk and it still tastes great. Ingredients in the mix are corn meal, white rice flour, baking powder (corn), and salt. The label states it also contains soy, but I can't find any ingredient with soy (such as soy lecithin) on the box's labeling. It could be that it is manufactured with machines that also process soy products, so, just to be safe, they mention the soy.This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it. But it is expensive, considering that you have to add most of the recipe to the mix. You are paying for the convenience of not having to sift your own corn meal and rice flower.","positive","positive","0.392241","0.235932"

Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item). The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them. My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few. I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard. It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell. At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste). My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.

The only reason I have not given it five stars is that I think they are too expensive, particularly the seed kits. I hope that as their popularity grows the price will come down. At two weeks all the seed pods had sprouted. They are expected to sprout at different times as indicated on the seed pods and all sprouted on schedule or earlier. I'm new to reviewing and would like to upload a picture but not sure that is possible.The set up was ridiculously easy but I do recommend you read the instructions as doing things in a certain order is needed. Also you are supposed to put the seed pods in in a specific order (as they are in the box) I didn't read that part first and took them out of the separate seed kit box so then didn't know what order to put them in. I think this is a likely error and a list of order they are to be inserted in enclosed in the box would avoid the problem. I guessed on the order and they seem to be growing well.After set up you just add water and nutrients and then again in the future when the machine tells you to with flashing lights. Couldn't be easier!! The instruction booklet is short ( nice for those of us who don't like reading instructions :) The only part that can be confusing is the adding of nutrients. The instruction book refers to tablets/pellets but what you receive is plastic tubes of liquid and you don't add as many tubes as the instruction says you should add tablets. Just ensure you read the nutrient amount info in the instruction book in the seed pod box for guidance on this and ignore it in the master instruction book. Also you add more or less nutrients depending on whether you have 3 or 6 or 7 pod gardens so read carefully.The light is super bright. You don't want it where you are sleeping. I have it in the kitchen and I put a three sided board in front of it at night ( small version of what kids use at science faires for their exhibits to block out the light as it seeps into the bedroom nearby. Herbs have 7 to 8 hours a day where the lights are off so I set the timer to turn the lights off at 11 PM and they automatically come back on 8 hours later. This is a fabulous feature and super easy to operate.The pump was so quiet that at first I didn't think it was working.So except that I would like a lower price I HIGHLY recommend this product and can't wait to enjoy the herbs that after 2 and a half weeks are almost ready to start harvestingUPDATE after two weeks one of the bulbs died. I contacted customer service and they immediately said they would send a replacement. I was disapointed it was a week before they confirmed it had shipped but they have shipped two new bulbs and even with just one currently working the herbs have continued to grow and I have had so much basil that I have had to harvest some.","positive","negative","0.911427","-0.0165942"

I won't repeat earlier posts describing what-all is involved with planting/maintenance.

Still, I abso-freaking-lutely LOVE it! This totally satisfies my ""Gardening Itch"" thru the winter months!

I don't have to do anything except occasionally add more water, and the Aerogrow even alerts me as to when to do this. I can't wait to have fresh herbs during winter when they are hard to grow indoors.The ""seed kits"" are seeds in a little sponge that is encased with a plastic housing. The plastic fits into small holes in the Aerogrow. The root system pushes out of the sponge and plastic housing and down into the water tank below. Nutrients are occasionally placed into the water tank. The Aerogrow has lights to alert when nutrients should be added. This is not rocket science. In fact, I removed the provided seeds from one of the sponges and replaced them with cucumber seeds that I'd bought, and literally within 3 days I had a plant that was 3 inches tall. When you buy seed kits, you are paying for the sponge and plastic housing that fits into the Aerogrow. Yes, this is a rip off and a crafty person could probably replicate the housing and use another type of sponge to avoid having to buy more costly seed kits.The Aerogrow is costly, as are the component parts.

As long as I keep the monsters in check the others do fine with the exception of the chives. They're just a thin sprig that I haven't been able to use.

Nothing serious, but little things that once added up may have led me to steer clear of this system.Let's just say I'm glad I read about it after I bought it. It was delivered early (Thanks AeroGrow), was securely packaged and after reading the ABC instructions, it was setup in no time at all. I estimate under an hour - maybe 45 minutes. That was almost two weeks ago and for the last few days, I've been noticing sprouts poking their heads outside the seed pod labels - 5 so far.I am impressed with the quality of the product and simplicity of the design. Everything in one neat little package - simple to use - easy re-ordering system whether through the catalogue or online. The prices may seem steep but you're paying for simplicity and convenience - the fact is that it is literally a plug and play system. You need to know how to do some very simple assembly, fill a reservoir with water, empty a couple nutrient packs and plug it in...it couldn't be simpler. The seed pods fit snuggly into the holes in the growing area and the clear plastic caps create a greenhouse effect for each plant.I'm so impressed with it, I bought a second unit to grow full sized plants.","","positive","0","0.503662"

It's more or less fool proof in that you supply water and nutrients when the light flashes on the front. The newer units are very quiet so they're perfect for a kitchen or office and yield maybe $100 of herbs over the course of a harvest. The lights operate on a timer so it really is very simple to operate.Here are a few kinks and quirks:- The life-cycle could last much longer if they gave you more nutrient. While I understand the desire to sell more pods, it's somewhat wasteful to kill the plants just because there's no more feed left.- Some of the seed kits are bland - out of 7 pods, one I ordered had three different types of basil. I like basil but not that much basil! Others have a better variety so definitely check before ordering.- Spiders and bugs do like attacking the plant and I haven't found much information on what to do about this. I had a million little spiders living in the thing during the final harvest so had to dump the crop.- Pods are not foolproof - some simply do not grow. To the manufacturer's credit, they'll replace any that don't germinate so don't forget to contact them if this happens to you.Still it's a good system and I can only believe it will get better with subsequent iterations. If I could buy the pods for half the price or get the nutrient in bulk, it would be perfect, especially given the inflated price of herbs in supermarkets.","neutral","negative","0","-0.0272354"

Every herb plant (from the Gourmet Herb seed pod kit that came with it) came up and before the full time allotted ran out. Most were nicely ahead of schedule. I am just about to the end of the first two week germination period, so we'll see if the ""add nutrient"" lights come on properly.The unit has been through several short power failures and nothing has disrupted the scheduling of the lights going on and off at the proper times. The light is bright, yes... but not so bright as a sunny window. My unit is in a finished basement room where I can keep it shut away from my plant-destroying young cats. Were it not for the cats, it *would* be on my kitchen counter! However, before you buy one, you should be sure you have a good place to keep it and won't be bothered by the light. It is on 17 hours a day during the herb cycle. Me, I like light.We did have one scare, when my husband smelled a burning smell coming from the unit one night. The smell was completely gone by morning when he told me about it and I checked the unit but I called Customer Service anyway. I was pleasantly surprised not to have to wait on hold. They said that sometimes there is a coating on the plastic that burns off within the first 3-4 days. OK... this happened perhaps just past that point, at about 4-5 days, so I assume it was just what they said. No further instances of strange smells since. Still, it was quite worrisome at the time, so I could wish the company might mention this possible occurrence in the manual so one might be prepared! They did give me a quick way to check and be sure it wasn't my pump burnt out... and it clearly wasn't. So I felt safe continuing to run the unit and appreciated the quick help. The pump has so far been VERY quiet, almost silent, actually.I'm looking forward to seeing how my herbs grow. If they do well, I think I'll start looking for a place to put a secondary and possibly a third unit. Perhaps using one of those accessory wall stands. The one drawback of course is that you get hooked into needing to buy their seed or master gardener kits, their nutrient tablets and their grow bulbs (which are supposed to be replaced at six month intervals). So this is probably NOT the most cost effective way to grow. OTOH... I can look forward to basil that is not half-destroyed by earwigs! And FRESH herbs when all is frozen and brown outside. It's surely an EASY way to garden!Update: April 2010Still using my Aerogarden Classic! That first herb garden was wildly successful! In fact, I've bought more and currently have NINE assorted Aerogardens! On the cat issue, I've found that the cats don't go after my herbs, just lettuce. So I *do* have an Aerogarden growing herbs in the kitchen now. Any gardens the cats might bother or where I might be growing a plant that is toxic for cats stays in my basement room. I'm harvesting abundant basil, dill, thyme and cilantro at the moment.I mostly do my own seeds now, using Park Seed bio-sponges, General Hydroponics Flora series liquid nutrients and making my own labels. I save and reuse all the plastic pod baskets I have received with various seed kits. It's more economic than buying extra Aerogarden supplies. At any rate, this first Classic garden is continuing to function beautifully, no pump failures or any issues, though I do keep a spare pump on hand. I replace the bulbs once a year. I have a mixed romaine/endive/arugula/chervil garden that has recently sprouted and growing right now. I've also used this original garden with the Aerogarden Seed Starter Tray and that works very well too. I'm a happy Aerogardener!My favorite Aerogardens are the tall gardensAeroGarden 900380-1200 VeggiePro for Full-Sized Vegetables, but I'm also fond of the little 3-pod gardens, which are super for flowers. I've grown tomatoes, green beans, chard, lettuce, greens, baby bok choy, petunias and various herbs in my gardens so far. I'm trying baby bell peppers right now, though those have just sprouted. For those needing help or ideas for their gardens, I highly recommend the Aerogarden Growers Community Forum.Update: May 2010On harvests... don't expect a single Aerogarden to provide for a large family. However, if I harvest heavily, I can usually get about 100g of lettuce (enough to fill two large pasta bowls or make 3-4 smaller side salads) about every 5 days or so. I get even larger amounts of chard weekly and it is fresh and tender and mild enough to eat raw. Herb gardens do provide fairly abundant harvests, it's difficult sometimes for hubby and I to keep up with the garden! However, the fact that it produces so well does encourage me to use a lot of fresh herbs! Overall, I definitely feel my Aerogardens contribute to healthier eating! And I use the extra spillover light to help start other plants for outdoors. And grow cat grass.","positive","positive","0.454525","0.2553"

Since there was a lot of basil, I layed the leaves on a piece cut from a paper bag, let them dry out, and put them in a glass jar. Mint was a bust, which I'm not surprised since the way it grows isn't conducive to a small area. Cilantro was ok, but nothing really looked as lush (except basil) than on the display photo. If I tried this kit again, I'm sure it'd go better by not having the basil choke out the other plants.I did the salad greens/leaf lettuce kit, too.

The herbs were wonderful, with the exception of the chives. Having fresh pestos and cilantro through the colder months was great. After we used up the tablets last spring, we planted the entire insert into window boxes and continued to get great harvests all summer - in fact the chives came back this spring and are growing better than they did last year. Tomatoes were a disappointment - it was hard to get the flowers fertilized, and the ones that started growing kept running into the light. The yellow produced a decent amount, but the reds did not start to produce until we were running out of tablets. The only good thing is that once they were at this size, they stayed healthy even without pump running or tablets, and now we have them in the garden and will have to wait if they continue to produce. Letting the machine soak in water for a bit after the aerogarden has been dry is recommended to soften the roots and lesson the noise. We also found that a good cleaning of the metal contacts on the lightpost and the pump with isopropanol was essential. We got a free pump replacement, but in retrospect, the first pump would have been fine with cleaning the contacts.","positive","positive","0.732756","0.335506"

Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor. White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality. There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth. This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.Cons: The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing. The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate. The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark. I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark. However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite. The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.

As for varied uses, it's equally great for strengthening the teeth (and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast, and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten) when eaten as a cracker, or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes. Oh, some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads, which means what's inside is edible for humans too. I keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable. Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well.

Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor. White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality. There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth. This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.Cons: The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing. The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate. The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark. I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark. However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite. The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy. Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark.","positive","positive","0.599891","0.195674"

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""",0.916666666666667,5,2006-02-20 19:00:00,"BEST KIND OF OIL WITH THE MOST IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS","IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this brand exclusively. Here's why.""COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL"" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:-----*- Certification from the ""I.S.O."" - ""International Standardization Organization""-----*- ""Certified Authentic Product of Italy"", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions-----*- Natural product, just olive oil - nothing added-----*- Excellent full-bodied tasteWhat are the nutritional components?A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable-derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta-carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.HEALTH BENEFITS:PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-FatWHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17-ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.]","positive","positive","0.932362","0.125434"

Not only that, but it seems that it does so as good if not better than any herbal tea advertised as helping with respiratory ailments. The ingredient profile offers a potential explanation: in addition to the ""dreadful"" artificial flavor that some reviewers seem to be getting hung up about, the tea contains rooibos, chicory root, rosehips, cinnamon, peppermint, lemongrass, papaya leaves, chamomile, panax ginseng leaves, anise seed, dandelion root, ginger root, orange peel and orange oil. I suspect that the aromatic herbs and the papaya are what really help to cut the snot. So, to my fellow sinus sufferers, I implore you to put this in your pot and brew it. And let me know on via review on Amazon if you share the same suspicions. EDIT: I'm not sure if it's the vasoconstrictive effect from the mild amount of caffeine in the caffeinated version of this tea, versus the herbal formulation, that was responsible for its decongestant effect.","negative","negative","-0.447878","-0.513126"

Why, oh why, did Good Earth have to change this tea, when it was perfectly fine and good the way it was? I am terribly disappointed by this change, and have amended my star rating to reflect this.Original Review - 10/4/2010First, to the Natural/Artificial concerns - it really does say Natural Flavors in the ingredient list, NOT artificial as some of the reviews state. Box also states ""No sugar, caffeine, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives"". I've submitted a picture of the ingredients list to Amazon, which you can view at the top of this item page.Ingredients list:Red Rooibos, Chicory Root, Natural Flavor, Rosehips, Cinnamon, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Papaya, Chamomile, Panax Ginseng Leaves, Anise Seed, Dandelion Root, Ginger Root, Orange Oil, Orange Peel.I was given my first box of this tea by a friend who knew I liked cinnamon tea. Up to that point, my favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice. But when I tried Good Earth, I fell in love! Now I cannot find it anymore in any of the local stores that carried it, so I signed up for the regular shipments from Amazon.Everyone I have shared this tea with tell me how much they enjoy it, that it hardly seems possible for tea to have such intense flavor and not need sweetening. I have to be sure to get some before my husband & kids finish the box without my getting a chance to have a few myself! Seems like every time I visit my mom now, she makes up some of this for us to share as some iced tea.I do not use any sweetener, which says a lot because I use sweetener with pretty much every other kind of herbal tea I drink. Good Earth is great hot or cold, and it sure does give my tastebuds a gingerbread-like warmth on a fall or winter morning. There is no tea-ish, bitter taste or aftertaste.If you love cinnamon, gingerbread, or a really good caffeine-free tea that doesn't need sweetening, give this one a try!","positive","positive","0.43022","0.113867"

Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a ""spice flavor not found in nature,"" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.If you like this, you may also enjoyCelestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

But finding tea that does well in the sun is difficult. The regular teas (black, green, white) become bitter when left standing too long, not surprisingly a requirement for sun tea. The herbals (fruits, chamomiles, mints) never seem to steep well in the sun and are generally bland & lack-luster. But this tea ... ah, heaven. Deep, robust, sweet, well-rounded. Personally, I think it is better as a sun tea than steeped the traditional way with hot water.This tea steeps well in morning or afternoon sun. I always use glass (never plastic) and 6 bags for about 1.5 quarts. Makes a fantastic tea in 3-4 hours, and letting it sit for a couple more hours produces a tea that definitely needs to be watered down. Needs no sugar, no lemon. Perfect as is. Awesome, just awesome. I wouldn't go a summer without it.I pick it up at Trader Joe's, and occassionally I find it at Target and Wal-mart.

I used to have great appreciation for your company and a great love for your product.

Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a ""spice flavor not found in nature,"" they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.If you like this, you may also enjoyCelestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

There is a distant hint of the old flavor that I pine for each time I take a sip, but what I am mostly met with is a harsh and unappealing flavor, and the longer it brews it just gets grosser rather than sweeter and spicier.

It's great hot and it makes terrific iced tea. So here's the tiny complaint: every once in a while, I get a bag of it that tastes bitter. I've always assumed that the random collection of spices in that particular tea bag just happened to contain too much of something in the spice mix. I know if that was my first taste of Good Earth tea, I'd never try it again! The bitterness problem has always been rare and random until recently. First I accidentally ordered a batch that wasn't caffeine free, and noticed toward the end of that supply that I didn't remember having any bitter bags. When I re-ordered the next supply - caffeine free, I got so many bitter bags that I almost gave up on my beloved Good Earth tea.

I have to change my review, because Tata Brands (their owner) changed the product and the packaging and the packaging description is inconsistent and even deceptive.The box claims this is Good Earth ""original"" tea. This is not true. The original version was all natural. This ""updated"" version contains artificial flavors and you can taste it. The packaging states on one side of the box that it is an all natural product, and on another panel it states that artificial flavors have been added. Since Amazon does not take returns on such products, I wrote to the parent company, Tata in Montvale, New Jersey, if they would make good on my purchase, either through a refund, or replacement. They now offer the ""original"" version again. It's all natural again. Now the call it ""organic"" and it costs more. Don't marketing departments realize that real people buy their products and this kind of playing games is offensive. I wouldn't be so negative if I had heard back from Tata, but I haven't. I had bought $103. worth of this tea which I will now throw away because I have not heard back from Tata, and this isn't the ""product"" I ordered.If Tata does indeed make good on this bad purchase, I will change my review. but I wrote to them over two months ago.Previous review:(I normally only drink tea when I'm sick. This tea is the exception! There's nothing like it. I drink it whenever and gladly serve it to guests.Back in the late 70's and 80's I always enjoyed this tea at Good Earth Restaurants in California, which was their signature drink, served hot or iced. The tea is obviously one of the only things that remains from that restaurant.The tea is incredibly sweet, needing no sugar or sweetener and it's strong enough that two bags can easily make a carafe of 4-5 cups. You can find it in supermarkets in California, but not in Florida. I have it delivered to Florida then bring it back with me to Germany. It's great that I can order it in quantity from Amazon.

The green tea was enjoyable, but not memorable.The one thing that disappointed me was the number of decaf teas that were included.

Unfortunately, I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers, for the following reasons:1) To me, this doesn't taste like jasmine blossoms. Instead, it tastes and smells like artificial banana flavoring -- like what you'd find in banana-flavored chewing gum or Jelly Bellies. I don't even care for real bananas all that much, so this is definitely not a good thing.2) Speaking of flavoring -- the list of ingredients says ""Organic Jasmine Green Tea and Organic Flavor."" What the heck is ""Organic Flavor""? Oh, they must mean ""organic artificial-banana flavoring."" ;)3) The strings of the tea bags are attached to the bag with a mini-staple. First off, I'm not too keen on the idea of brewing metal staples along with my tea. Second, one of the strings detached from its bag because the staple didn't hold it in place well enough -- and this happened the very first time I tried this tea. The detached string was a minor annoyance, but what if the staple itself detached from the bag and into the tea?

I previously ordered in 2009 and, again, in 2010. In both of those cases, the product came in a package of different design that contained 25 bags per box. I paid $21 in 2009 and $25 in 2010 (for six packages, in each case); thus, the price has not changed significantly in the past few years.Two days ago I found a lonely box of this tea hidden in the back of my cupboard, and, while it bears an ""enjoy by"" date of May 2011, it is still tasty as of this writing in February of 2012.I agree with the other two reviewers: this is a nice tea (and one can also enjoy it as an iced tea). It has a wonderful flavor, and seems to have a soothing effect on my aching knees... so much so, that, after feeling the positive effects of this tea for the first time, and believing that that ""healing"" effect might be a result of the eleuthero, the second-listed ingredient, I actually bought eleuthero capsules to use as a daily supplement. As they did not seem to be as effective in easing the pain in my knees, I am reordering the tea and skipping the supplements.According to Good Earth's own blurb from my previous purchases, this tea contains no caffeine... how they manage that with green tea, I am not sure. I am also not sure why they feel the need to add natural flavors (containing soy lecithin) as the third ingredient.Besides the benefit of what I believe to be this tea's ""healing properties"", it is just a wonderful tea to enjoy with friends after dinner.The old container was made from 100% recycled materials. I'll give an update on the new container.","positive","positive","0.954388","0.312997"

We are told to eat this and that and we will live better, or told it's products are AMAZING!!! Well........the one product that continually gets rave reviews again and again is green tea. So I decided to drink at least 4-6 cups of green tea a day. it's antioxident properties are amazing. Research again and again shows that it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular (heart) disease. It eliminates free radicals in the blood stream that put you at risk for many different diseases. Now, I'm' not a health nut but I do value my health. I try to eat well 80% of the time and I exercise regularly and try to watch my stress. But this tea has been an added to my menu and I abslutely LOVE it. I have tried so many different green teas that I can't even begin to count the number and names. Good Earth always makes an amazing product in quality. This tea is no exception. I feel it has a slight tint of sweetness because of the lemongrass and it's not as bitter. It's very smooth for a green tea. It is light and refreshing and I feel reenergized. I boil 6-8 cups of water on the stove every day in a pan and add 4-6 bags of this tea. I let the tea bags sit in the water and steep for about 20 minutes. This is what allows the valuable products of the green tea to be absorbed into the water. I may drink a cup of warm tea and that point, but I refrigerate the rest. I put it in a couple of containers, let it cool on the counter and then put it in the fridge. When I'm ready to drink it, I may add a little coffee creamer or splenda. YUM! It has become my new morning coffee. I absolutely LOVE this tea. Thank you, Good Earth.","positive","positive","0.777403","0.357992"

This tea is not purely green tea leaves - it also contains lemongrass and other flavors. It is flavorful but mild. Ingredients: Decaffeinated Green Tea, Lemongrass, Natural Flavors (Contains Soy Lecithin), Rose Petals and Peppermint.Be aware that the Good Earth Decaf Green Tea does not have the more delicate flavor as real Japanese green tea (and not a roasted flavor like Genmai), but it is great as an everyday tea. If you are expecting green tea like in Japanese restaurants, this is not it - if you want that, get high quality loose tea leaves and brew it with the correct temperature water in a teapot. (Although maybe the Good Earth green tea would taste more similar to Japanese green tea if brewed like Japanese green tea should be - read on...)I often leave my tea bag steeping for a long time (I know, not recommended for green tea, but it likely does extract more of the beneficial antioxidants), up to 30 min, and this tea does not get bitter. It also does not get bitter if the tea sits around before drinking. One Good Earth tea bag works fine for my large 16 oz mug. I have found that other brands of tea can be weak and not flavorful if using only one bag for 16 oz water.I also like that this tea is decaf since even the smaller amount of caffeine in green tea affects me. Decaf green teas are somewhat hard to find. This company uses a CO2 process for decaffeination, preferable to a solvent extraction process.Note that this product is available in 18-count and 25-count boxes. My local grocery store has stopped carrying the 25-count and only stocks the 18-count. I like that Amazon carries the 25-count boxes since I go through a lot of this tea! It is also a better deal at Amazon.I have tried many other brands of green tea (decaf and regular) over the years and keep coming back to Good Earth brand.
